So you’ve installed [CommandBox](../../running-boxlang/commandbox.md) and are running the latest BoxLang server like a boss. You open up your browser and are met with an error message. This looks like a job for, you guessed it, the BoxLang VS Code Debugger!

## Hooking VS Code Up To Your Server

Connecting your debugger to an external may seem intimidating but CommandBox + VS Code makes this pretty straightforward.

### Configuring CommandBox

To start we will need to make sure our server is configured properly. You can do this one of two ways.

1. We can add `JVMArgs` to the CLI when starting a BoxLang CommandBox server:

```bash
server start cfengine=boxlang 
  javaVersion=openjdk21_jdk 
  JVMArgs='-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8888'
```

2. The alternative approach is to add some configuration to our `server.json` definition:

```json
{
  "JVM": {
    "args": "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8888",
    "javaVersion": "openjdk21_jdk"
  }
}
```

In these examples I’ve used port `8888` as the port we want the debugger to connect to control the CommandBox server through. You can specify whatever open port you want. You just need to make sure that you use the same one at every step.

Once you start your server it should run as normal.

### Configuring VS Code

Now that your server is configured, we need to setup VS Code. We will need to update your `.vscode/launch.json`. If you don’t see this file, you can create it yourself and VS Code will pick it up.

We want the `launch.json` to look something like this:

```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug CommandBox",
      "type": "boxlang",
      "request": "attach",
       // make sure this is the same value you configured your server with            
      "serverPort": "8888"
    }
  ]
}
```

That's it.  Now VSCode will know to what port to connect to your debugger running inside of CommandBox.

### Starting a Debug Session

At this point your server is configured, it’s running, and you have just added a launch configuration. The next step is to run the debugger. All we need to do is open up the debug tab in our side-panel and select the correct configuration, which is the one we just added `Debug CommandBox`

Now that we have everything setup all we need to do is press “play” or hit `f5` and VS Code will fire up the BoxLang debugger and attach to your BoxLang server.  That's it!  Go add some breakpoints, go create some bugs and then fix them!
