# Release History

### Versioning Schema <a href="#versioning-schema" id="versioning-schema"></a>

BoxLang is maintained under the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered in the following format:

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bump the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch

### LTS - Support Policy

For all BoxLang releases, updates are provided for 12 months, and security fixes are provided for 2 years after the next major release.

| Version | Release | Updates | Security Fixes |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | -------------- |
| **1.x** | 2024    | 2025    | 2027           |
| **2.x** | 2025    | 2026    | ???            |
