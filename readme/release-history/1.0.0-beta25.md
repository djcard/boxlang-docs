# 1.0.0-Beta25

## BoxLang Beta 25 Has Landed!

This release takes BoxLang to the next level, delivering a mix of critical bug fixes, thoughtful improvements, and exciting new features designed to enhance your development experience. With Beta25, we‚Äôve solidified and made the **ASM ByteCode BoxPiler** the default compiler, refined module, and logging management, and added long-requested query of queries and JSON-based logging encoders. Additionally, we‚Äôve tackled critical issues around debugging, compatibility, and system settings to make this the most stable and feature-complete beta yet.

At this point, we have a handful of small bugs open, which will completely certify all of the major Ortus frameworks like ColdBox, ContentBox, and over 50 modules.  Complete certification is around the corner.

As a bonus, we are almost ready to release our Hibernate ORM module (`bx-orm`) and move into a Release Candidate phase for our entire lineup.  So please test test test, and give us your feedback.
